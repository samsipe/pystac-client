## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Logging is now enabled in the CLI in all cases.
  If data are being printed to stdout, logging goes to stderr.
  [#79](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac-client/pull/79)

## [v0.2.0-rc.1] - 2021-07-30

### Added

- `Client.open` falls back to the `STAC_URL` environment variable if no url is provided as an argument [#48](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac-client/pull/48)
- New Search.get_pages() iterator function to retrieve pages as raw JSON, not as ItemCollections
- `StacApiIO` class added, subclass from PySTAC `StacIO`. A `StacApiIO` instance is used for all IO for a Client instance, and all requests
are in a single HTTP session, handle pagination and respects conformance
- `conformance.CONFORMANCE_CLASSES` dictionary added containing all STAC API Capabilities from stac-api-spec
- `collections` subcommand to CLI, for saving all Collections in catalog as JSON
- `Client.get_collections` overrides Catalog to use /collections endpoint if API conforms
- `Client.get_collection(<collection_id>)` for getting specific collection
- `Client.get_items` and `Client.get_all_items` override Catalog functions to use search endpoint instead of traversing catalog

### Changed

- Update to use PySTAC 1.1.0
- IO changed to use PySTAC's new StacIO base class. 
- `Search.item_collections()` renamed to `Search.get_item_collections()`
- `Search.item_collections()` renamed to `Search.get_items()`
- Conformance is checked by each individual function that requires a particular conformance
- STAC API testing URLs changed to updated APIs
- `ItemSearch.get_pages()` function moved to StacApiIO class for general use

### Fixed

- Running `stac-client` with no arguments no longer raises a confusing exception [#52](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac-client/pull/52)
- `Client.get_collections_list` [#44](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac-client/issues/44)
- The regular expression used for datetime parsing [#59](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac-client/pull/59)
- `Client.from_file` now works as expected, using `Client.open` is not required, although it will fetch STAC_URL from an envvar

### Removed

- `get_pages` and `simple_stac_resolver` functions from `pystac_client.stac_io` (The new StacApiIO class understands `Link` objects)
- `Client.search()` no longer accepts a `next_resolver` argument
- pystac.extensions modules, which were based on PySTAC's previous extension implementation, replaced in 1.0.0
- `stac_api_object.StacApiObjectMixin`, replaced with conformance checking in `StacApiIO`
- PySTAC Collection objects can no longer be passed in as `collections` arguments to the `ItemSearch` class (just pass ids)
- `Catalog.get_collection_list` (was alias to `get_child_links`) because made assumption about this being an API only. Also redundant with `Catalog.get_collections`
- `Search.item_collections()`
- `Search.items()`

## [v0.1.1] - 2021-04-16

### Added

- `ItemSearch.items_as_collection` [#37](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac-client/pull/37)
- Documentation [published on ReadTheDocs](https://pystac-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [#46](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac-client/pull/46)

### Fixed

- Include headers in STAC_IO [#38](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac-client/pull/38)
- README updated to reflect actual CLI behavior

### Changed

- CLI: pass in heades as list of KEY=VALUE pairs
